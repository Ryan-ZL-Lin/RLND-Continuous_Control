## The Environment

### Unity ML-Agent
Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

For game developers, these trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release.

In this course, you will use Unity's rich environments to design, train, and evaluate your own deep reinforcement learning algorithms. You can read more about ML-Agents by perusing the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

Note: The Unity ML-Agent team frequently releases updated versions of their environment. We are using the v0.4 interface. To avoid any confusion, please use the workspace we provide here or work with v0.4 locally.

For this project, I work with the Reacher environment.
